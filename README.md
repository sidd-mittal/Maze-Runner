# Maze-Runner 
Maze-solving algorithm which finds the optimal path between a mouse, cheese, and exit using recursion, object-oriented concepts, and backtracking for optimization. An external file containing the maze itself is read-from and used to solve the maze.  

Currently developing a front-end utilizing modern Javascript frameworks/libraries (Angular, Material) - Connect with me to discuss!
